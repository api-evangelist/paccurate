These two values will be used in a simple linear model to guess carton price, i.e., <pre>cartonPrice = priceIncreaseRate * cartonWeight + basePrice<\/pre> Oftentimes, this will be enough to get accurate carton selections without needing to send complete customer-based rates. It's worth considering, as the prices are only estimates to be used in carton selection, with final rating of cartons happening outside of paccurate. This is the predicted rate of increase for a weight-based pricing model. The simplest way to find a servicable value is to take <pre>priceIncreaseRate = (maximumPrice - minimumPrice)\/(maximumWeight - minimumWeight)<\/pre> In the example above, this would yield <pre>priceIncreaseRate = ($20-$10)\/(3lbs-1lb)<br\/>priceIncreaseRate = $10\/2lbs<br\/>priceIncreaseRate = $5\/lb<\/pre>",
